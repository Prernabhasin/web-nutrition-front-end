# Recommended setup guide:
## Setup Visual Studio Code (VSC)
- [Download link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Open VSC and choose a folder (workspace)

## Setup git
- in VSC go to "Source Control" (third on the left tabsheet)
- click the three dots icon (...) and initialize git repository. Choose the workspace folder.
- press `` Ctrl+` `` or `` Cmd+` `` to open console/terminal to run commands.
- connect to this github repository using the command: `git remote add origin https://github.com/kevincentius/web-nutrition-front-end.git`
- you can now pull (download source code) via the three dots icon
- want to contribute in the front end? I will need your github username/email so I can make you collaborator (allow to push changes)

## Run the project
- go to chrome://extensions
- enable development mode (top right toggle)
- click "Load unpacked" and select the workspace folder (that contains manifest file)
- you should now see the rainbow chart icon on the Chrome toolbar
- if you edit the code, just click on refresh on the extension card. Changes should take effect immediately.
- If you never made Chrome extension, I recommend [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RNxrRmsMaI&index=3&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwg2-q6Kvw3Tl_4xhxtIaNlY)
