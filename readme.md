Recommended setup guide:
- IDE: [Visual Studio Code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Open VSC and choose a folder (workspace)
- Setup git:
	- go to the third tab ("Source Control" on the left tabsheet)
	- click the three dots icon (...) and initialize git repository. Choose the workspace folder.
	- press `` Ctrl+` `` or `` Cmd+` `` to open console/terminal to run commands.
	- connect to this github repository using the command: `git remote add origin git@github.com:kevincentius/web-nutrition-front-end.git`
	- you can now pull (do this first), stage, commit and push via the three dots icon
- Run the project on Chrome
	- go to chrome://extensions
	- enable development mode (top right toggle)
	- click "Load unpacked" and select the workspace folder (that contains manifest file)
	- you should now see the rainbow chart icon on the Chrome toolbar
	- if you edit the code, just click on refresh on the extension card. Changes should take effect immediately.
- If you never made Chrome extension, I recommend [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RNxrRmsMaI&index=3&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwg2-q6Kvw3Tl_4xhxtIaNlY)
